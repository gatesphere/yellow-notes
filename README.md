Yellow Notes
============

A command line idea manager


Overview
--------

Yellow Notes is a command line program to organize your ideas, in short snippets.

Yellow Notes is sort of a hybrid to-do list and scratchpad.  You can create notes,
which may have categories, priorities, due dates, names, and both short (<= 140 
characters) and long (any size) descriptions.  You may display notes by priority, 
date, due date, or category, or if you just want something to do, you can pick
a random note from your database.
